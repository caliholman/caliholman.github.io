title: "Bittersweet moments"

I had written half of a blog post to update you all on LEAD Conference and a few other things but then I recieved the email that changed everything. The email that told me that whether I was ready or not I would be returning back to the US, back to Wisconsin, and back to my parents house where I would have to stay for 14 days without seeing any of my other friends and family upon my return. It was the email that informed me I had 72 hours to make my way back to my village, say goodbye to all of my fellow teachers, my wonderful students and people in my community, to pack up my entire house and all my belongings in two suitcases, a hiking backpack and a small backpack, travel with all my things from my village to Lushoto town in order to say goodbye to all the wonderful friends I had made there, travel from Lushoto town to Korogwe where I would spend one night before getting picked up by a private bus hired by Peace Corps to take us all to Dar es Salaam.
