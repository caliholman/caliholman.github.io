Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author     my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be (th    anks to [jmglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)).
