# A Wee Bit About Mee

![cali south africa](/img/cali_south_africa.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

My name is Calista Holman and I am from Shell Lake, WI. I just graduated with a bachelor of science from Viterbo University in La Crosse, WI where I majored in biology and minored in chemistry. During my time at Viterbo I participated in two short term study abroad experiences to Costa Rica and South Africa. My time in South Africa as well as the class associated with it fueled my desire to serve and to be back in Africa. Now, I am beginning my post-graduate life as a Peace Corps Secondary School Science Education Volunteer in Tanzania, Africa. 

This blog will document my Peace Corps journey. I will be in Tanzania for 27 months from July of 2019 through October of 2021. The first three months will be dedicated to Pre-Service Training (PST) where I will live with a host family, learn about the culture, Swahili, how to teach my classes and other safety/survival skills (such as building a water filtration system). Midway through those three months, I will get assigned a site where I will spend the next two years. We do get vacation days throughout those two years in which I plan on traveling Tanzania as well as other African countries.
