It has been awhile since my last post, and a lot has happened! To start, I have some very exciting news! In my last post I shared the issue with obtaining work visas to legally work and volunteer here in Tanzania. Well, 8 months since arriving in Tanzania, we have finally received our work permits!!! Now I am officially able to stay here and serve my full 2 years of Peace Corps service!
	Now for a summary of what has taken place since my last post. My last month and a half has included a trip to Singida with my counterpart, Daniel, and four students for LEAD conference, a visit to the Lushoto District Hospital (first hospital experience in country…don’t worry I’m okay!), and a trip to Dar es Salaam to the Peace Corps office. It has been a busy past few weeks. It’s hard to believe that it is already the middle of March!
	LEAD conference in Singida was amazing and exhausting all at the same time. LEAD Conference is an entirely volunteer run conference. Jordan on USAWA committee planned and organized the event and all the funding was through a grant. All the volunteers who applied and were accepted to attend with counterparts and 4 students were required to plan and lead 2 sessions on various topics. My school lead a topic on team work and team building and then we had a student lead session on gender equality. Not only was I responsible to planning for and leading two sessions with my counterpart and students I also felt like I was a camp counselor for a week. For the conference 3 different guest houses (similar to hotels) were rented out. the counterparts were all staying in one, all the female students and two rooms of male students with a couple rooms for Peace Corps volunteers were in the guest house where the conference was held, and the rest of the male students and two Peace Corps Volunteers were in the third guest house. I was in the guest house where the entire conference was held. The entire week we were there I left the guest house complex only once and that was with the students for sports and games time. Other than that I was there with them 24/7. Eating meals 3 times a day with everyone, having chai and afternoon break together, sitting through/leading sessions all day and then partaking in the evening activities scheduled for the students. From the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep each day I was with the students. As exhausting as the week was it was completely worth it. My students got to travel outside of Tanga region (some students had never done so before) and meet students from other parts of Tanzania.
